# Event App â€“ Final React Project

## How to run this project

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate into the project folder
3. Run the following commands:

npm install
npm run dev

Make sure your JSON server is also running:

npx json-server --watch events.json --port 3000

## Project structure

This project was built as part of the React Advanced module at Winc Academy. It includes:

- Fetching data from a local server
- Routing with React Router
- Dynamic routes for events and users
- Modals for editing events
- Filter and search functionality

## Comments and code clarity

Throughout the code, comments follow this format:

```js
// vereiste X - explanation
```

This helps track each required feature ("vereiste") from the assignment. The numbering refers to the assignment requirements, not to execution order.

This setup helped me keep the logic clean and transparent while building the app.
